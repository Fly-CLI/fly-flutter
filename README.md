# Fly CLI - AI-Native Flutter Development Tool

**The first AI-native Flutter CLI tool designed for the era of AI-assisted development.**

## Overview

Fly CLI revolutionizes Flutter development by providing intelligent automation, multi-architecture support, and seamless integration with modern AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT.

## Current Status: Phase 0 - Critical Foundation

We're currently in Phase 0: establishing the security, compliance, testing infrastructure, and offline capabilities that are essential prerequisites for successful MVP delivery.

### Phase 0 Deliverables (7 days)

- **Security Framework** - Template validation, dependency scanning, sandboxing
- **License Compliance** - MIT compatibility audit, attribution system
- **Platform Testing** - Cross-platform CI/CD, platform-specific utilities
- **Offline Mode Architecture** - Template caching, network resilience

- ✅ AI-native architecture with JSON output and declarative manifests
- ✅ Multi-architecture support (MVVM, Clean, BLoC, Riverpod)
- ✅ Comprehensive foundation packages
- ✅ Interactive project wizards
- ✅ Offline mode support
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
