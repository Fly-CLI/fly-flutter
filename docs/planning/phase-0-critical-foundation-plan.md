# Phase 0: Critical Foundation Plan
**Fly CLI Implementation Roadmap**

**Phase:** 0 - Critical Foundation  
**Duration:** 1 Week (7 Days)  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 0 establishes the security, compliance, testing infrastructure, and platform support foundation that all subsequent development phases will build upon. This phase ensures the project is built on solid ground with proper security measures, legal compliance, cross-platform compatibility, and resilience mechanisms in place.

## Objectives

- ✅ Implement comprehensive security framework and template validation
- ✅ Complete license audit and ensure MIT compatibility for all dependencies  
- ✅ Establish robust platform testing infrastructure for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Design offline mode architecture for network resilience

## Daily Breakdown

### Days 1-2: Security Framework Implementation

#### Day 1: Template Validation System
- Create template security validator with multiple security checks
- Implement security issue data models and types
- Design template sandboxing architecture
- Create security policy documentation (SECURITY.md)

#### Day 2: Dependency Security & Sandboxing
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- Create template sandboxing mechanisms
- Design resource limits and permission model
- Write security best practices documentation

### Day 3: License Audit and Compliance

- Create license compatibility matrix documentation
- Implement automated license audit script
- Generate NOTICE file with all dependencies and attributions
- Validate MIT license compatibility for all dependencies
- Document license audit process

### Days 4-5: Platform Testing Infrastructure

#### Day 4: CI/CD Setup
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform testing
- Set up test matrix for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Implement platform-specific test utilities
- Create cross-platform file operations abstraction

#### Day 5: Shell Completion & Platform Utilities
- Implement Bash completion scripts
- Implement Zsh completion scripts
- Create platform abstraction layer
- Test platform-specific functionality

### Days 6-7: Offline Mode Architecture

#### Day 6: Template Caching System
- Design and implement local template caching
- Create cache management commands
- Implement cache validation and expiration
- Build cache size monitoring

#### Day 7: Network Resilience
- Implement offline fallback mechanisms
- Create network resilience with retry logic
- Write offline mode documentation
- Test offline functionality

## Key Deliverables

### Security Framework
- Template security validator (multiple validation checks)
- Security policy documentation (SECURITY.md)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning scripts
- Template sandboxing architecture design

### License Compliance
- License compatibility matrix documentation
- License audit implementation script
- NOTICE file with all attributions
- Automated license checking in CI

### Platform Testing
- Multi-platform CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions)
- Platform-specific test utilities
- Cross-platform file operations implementation
- Shell completion scripts (Bash, Zsh)

### Offline Mode
- Local template caching system
- Network resilience with retry logic
- Offline mode documentation
- Cache management commands

---

## Success Criteria

### Security Framework
- ✅ Template validator implements all security checks
- ✅ Security issues are properly categorized
- ✅ SECURITY.md is comprehensive
- ✅ Vulnerability scanner detects known CVEs
- ✅ Sandboxing architecture is documented

### License Compliance
- ✅ All dependencies audited
- ✅ NOTICE file contains all attributions
- ✅ License audit script runs successfully
- ✅ No incompatible licenses in dependencies

### Platform Testing
- ✅ CI tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Platform-specific tests pass
- ✅ File operations work on all platforms
- ✅ Shell completion works on Bash and Zsh

### Offline Mode
- ✅ Templates are cached locally
- ✅ Offline mode works without network
- ✅ Network resilience handles failures
- ✅ Cache management is functional

## Risk Mitigation

### Security Risks
- **Template injection attacks:** Template sandboxing + validation
- **Dependency vulnerabilities:** Automated scanning + audits

### License Risks
- **Incompatible licenses:** License audit automation

### Platform Risks
- **Platform-specific bugs:** Multi-platform CI + testing

### Offline Risks
- **Network failures:** Local caching + graceful fallback

---

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Phase 0, proceed to **Phase 1: MVP Launch** which includes foundation package implementation, core CLI commands, template engine integration, and AI integration features.
