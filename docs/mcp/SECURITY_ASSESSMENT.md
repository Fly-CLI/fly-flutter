## Conclusion

The Fly CLI MCP implementation demonstrates **solid security fundamentals** but requires enhancements to meet enterprise-grade standards. The most critical gaps are:

1. **Output verification** - No validation of tool outputs
2. **Audit logging** - No security event tracking
3. **Advanced rate limiting** - No per-client limits

With focused effort on the critical priorities, the implementation can achieve production-ready security within 4-6 weeks.

**Overall Assessment**: 🟡 **Good Foundation, Needs Enhancement**

**Recommended Action**: Prioritize output verification and audit logging immediately.
